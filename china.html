                        three millennia. Many of Beijing's 91 universities consistently rank among the best in
                        China, such as the Peking University and Tsinghua University.

                        skyline, museums and historic buildings—including the City God Temple, Yu Garden, the China
                        Pavilion and buildings along the Bund. Shanghai is also known for its sugary cuisine,
                        distinctive dialect and vibrant international flair. Every year, the city hosts numerous

                    <p>
                        The Great Wall of China is the collective name of a
                        series of fortification systems generally built across the historical northern borders of China
                        to protect and consolidate territories of Chinese states and empires against various nomadic
                        groups of the steppe and their polities. Several walls were being built from as early as the 7th
                        century BC by ancient Chinese states; selective stretches were later joined together by Qin
                        Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on,
                        many successive dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most
                        well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

                        and as such, the founder of the religion/philosophy Taoism.
